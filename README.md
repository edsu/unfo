unfo.py is a user unfriendly way of unfollowing a bunch of people at the
command line.

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    cp env-example .env
    # edit .env with keys
    python unfo.py edsu

I thought it would be nice to follow less people and found the Twitter interface a bit clunky for doing that.
