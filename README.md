unfo.py is a user unfriendly way of unfollowing a bunch of people at the
command line.

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    cp env-example .env
    # edit .env with keys
    python unfo.py edsu

I thought it would be nice to follow less people and found the Twitter
interface a bit clunky for doing that for a lot of people. So here is
a *really* clunky interface for unfollowing people that is optimized for me.
